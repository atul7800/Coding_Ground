### <span style="color:orange;">Why do we use callback functions?</span>

We use callback functions to:

1. Handle dependencies
2. Avoid code blocking
   - By using asynchronous operations and callback functions, JavaScript can perform tasks without blocking the execution of other code.
3. Code reusability
