# Thread

**_A thread refers to the smallest unit of a process that can be executed by Operating system._**

A computer program becomes a process when it is loaded in the computer's memory and begins execution. A process description in memory contains vital information such as the program counter which keeps track of the current position in the program (i.e. which instruction is currently being executed), registers, variable stores, file handles, signals, and so forth.

A thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code.
